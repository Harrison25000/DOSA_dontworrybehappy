# Team DOSA: MAKERS FINAL PROJECT

## Machine Learning Group: Facial Expression Recognition

**Project Objective:** This will mainly be a learning project, as Machine Learning is an area that is new to us. Nevertheless, we have an “MVP” to aim for, that will serve as a demonstration of our learning.

**MVP**: _We will develop an image classification machine learning algorithm for facial expression recognition: it looks at a photo of a face and can determine what emotion is expressed_
